                <h2>What is Python?</h2>
                    <p>Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.
                        <br>
                    It is used for:
                        <ul>
                            <li>web development (server-side),</li>
                            <li>software development,</li>
                            <li>mathematics,</li>

                <h2>Python Getting Started</h2>
                <h3>Python Install</h3>
                    <p>Many PCs and Macs will have python already intalled.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    To check if you have python installed on a Windows PC, search in the start bar for Python or run the following on the Command Line (cmd.exe):
                    </p>
                    
                    <pre>
                        <code>C:\Users\Your Name>python --version</code>
                    </pre>

                    <p>To check if you have python installed on a Linux or Mac, then on linux open the command line or on Mac open the Terminal and type:
                    </p>

                    <pre>
                        <code>python --version</code>
                    </pre>

                    <p>If you find that you do not have python installed on your computer, then you can download it for free from the following website: 
                        <a href="https://www.python.org/">https://www.python.org/
                        </a>
                    </p>
                    <h3>Python Quick Start</h3>
                        <p>
                            Python is an interpreted programming language, this means that as a developer you write Python (.py) files in a text editor and then put those files into the python interpreter to be executed.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The way to run a python file is like this on the command line:
                        </p>
                        
                        <pre>
                            <code>C:\Users\Your Name>python helloworld.py</code>
                        </pre>
                        
                        <p>
                            Where "helloworld.py" is the name of your python file.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Let's write our first Python file, called helloworld.py, which can be done in any text editor.
                        </p>
                        
                        <pre>
                            <code>print("Hello, World!")</code>
                        </pre>
                        
                        <p>
                            Simple as that. Save your file. Open your command line, navigate to the directory where you saved your file, and run:
                        </p>
                        
                        <pre>
                            <code>C:\Users\Your Name>python helloworld.py
                            </code>
                        </pre>
                        
                        <p>
                            The output should read:
                        </p>
                        
                        <pre>
                            <code>
                                Hello, World!
                            </code>
                        </pre>
                        
                        <p>
                            Congratulations, you have written and executed your first Python program.
                        </p>

                <h2>Python Syntax</h2>
                <h3>Python Indentation</h3>
                    <p>Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.</p>
                    <p>Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important.</p>
                    <p>Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.</p>
                    <pre>
                        <code>if 5 > 2:
                            print("Five is greater than two!")</code>
                    </pre>
                    <p>The number of spaces is up to you as a programmer, but it has to be at least one.</p>
                    <pre>
                        <code>if 5 > 2:
                            print("Five is greater than two!")  
                           if 5 > 2:
                                   print("Five is greater than two!")
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                    <p>
                        You have to use the same number of spaces in the same block of code, otherwise Python will give you an error.
                    </p>

                <h2>Python Comments</h2>
                <p>
                    Comments can be used to explain Python code.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Comments can be used to make the code more readable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Comments can be used to prevent execution when testing code.
                </p>
                <h3>Creating a Comment</h3>
                <p>
                    Comments starts with a #, and Python will ignore them:
                </p>
                <pre>
                    <code>
                        #This is a comment
                        print("Hello, World!")
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <h3>Multi Line Comments</h3>
                    <p>
                        Python does not really have a syntax for multi line comments.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To add a multiline comment you could insert a # for each line:
                    </p>
                    
                    <pre>
                        <code>
                            #This is a comment
                            #written in
                            #more than just one line
                            print("Hello, World!")
                        </code>
