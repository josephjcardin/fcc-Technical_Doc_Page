            <p>Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.</p>

            <p>
                It is used for:
                    <ul>
                        <li>web development (server-side),</li>
                        <li>software development,</li>
                        <li>mathematics,</li>
                        <li>system scripting.</li>
                    </ul>
            </p>
            
            <h3>What can Python do?</h3>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Python can be used on a server to create web applications.</li>
                        <li>Python can be used alongside software to create workflows.</li>
                        <li>Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files.</li>
                        <li>Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.</li>
                        <li>Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.</li>

            <h3>Python Install</h3>
                <p>Many PCs and Macs will have python already intalled.
                </p>
                <p>
                To check if you have python installed on a Windows PC, search in the start bar for Python or run the following on the Command Line (cmd.exe):
                </p>
                    
                <pre>
                    <code>C:\Users\Your Name>python --version</code>
                </pre>

                <p>To check if you have python installed on a Linux or Mac, then on linux open the command line or on Mac open the Terminal and type:
                </p>

                <pre>
                    <code>python --version</code>
                </pre>

                <p>If you find that you do not have python installed on your computer, then you can download it for free from the following website: 
                    <a href="https://www.python.org/">https://www.python.org/
                    </a>
                </p>
                
                <h3>Python Quick Start</h3>
                    <p>
                        Python is an interpreted programming language, this means that as a developer you write Python (.py) files in a text editor and then put those files into the python interpreter to be executed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The way to run a python file is like this on the command line:
                    </p>
                        
                    <pre>
                        <code>C:\Users\Your Name>python helloworld.py</code>
                    </pre>
                        
                    <p>
                        Where "helloworld.py" is the name of your python file.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Let's write our first Python file, called helloworld.py, which can be done in any text editor.
                    </p>
                        
                    <pre>
                        <code>print("Hello, World!")</code>
                    </pre>
                    
                    <p>
                        Simple as that. Save your file. Open your command line, navigate to the directory where you saved your file, and run:
                    </p>
                        
                    <pre>
                        <code>C:\Users\Your Name>python helloworld.py
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                    
                    <p>
                        The output should read:
                    </p>
                        
                    <pre>
                        <code>
                            Hello, World!
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                    
                    <p>
                        Congratulations, you have written and executed your first Python program.
                    </p>

            <h3>Python Indentation</h3>
                <p>Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.</p>
                <p>Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important.</p>
                <p>Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.</p>
                <pre>
                    <code>if 5 > 2:
                        print("Five is greater than two!")</code>
                </pre>
                <p>The number of spaces is up to you as a programmer, but it has to be at least one.</p>
                <pre>
                    <code>if 5 > 2:
                        print("Five is greater than two!")  
                        if 5 > 2:
                                print("Five is greater than two!")
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <p>
                    You have to use the same number of spaces in the same block of code, otherwise Python will give you an error.
                </p>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="Python_Comments">
            <header>Python Comments</header>
            <p>
                Comments can be used to explain Python code.
            </p>
            <p>
                Comments can be used to make the code more readable.
            </p>
            <p>
                Comments can be used to prevent execution when testing code.
            </p>
            <h3>Creating a Comment</h3>
            <p>
                Comments starts with a #, and Python will ignore them:
            </p>
            <pre>
                <code>
                    #This is a comment
                    print("Hello, World!")
                </code>
            </pre>
            <h3>Multi Line Comments</h3>
                <p>
                    Python does not really have a syntax for multi line comments.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To add a multiline comment you could insert a # for each line:
                </p>
                
                <pre>
                    <code>
                        #This is a comment
                        #written in
                        #more than just one line
                        print("Hello, World!")
                    </code>
                </pre>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="Python_Variables">
            <header >Python Variables</header>
                <h3>Creating Variables</h3>
                    <p>
                        Variables are containers for storing data values.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Unlike other programming languages, Python has no command for declaring a variable.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.
                    </p>
                    <pre>
                        <code>
                            x = 5
                            y = "John"
                            print(x)
                            print(y)
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                    <p>
                        Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type and can even change type after they have been set.
                    </p>
                    <pre>
                        <code>
                            x = 4 # x is of type int
                            x = "Sally" # x is now of type str
                            print(x)
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                    <p>
                        String variables can be declared either by using single or double quotes:
                    </p>
                    <pre>
                        <code>
                            x = "John"
                            # is the same as
                            x = 'John'
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                <h3>Variable Names</h3>
                    <p>
                        A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume). Rules for Python variables:
                    </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character</li>
                            <li>A variable name cannot start with a number</li>
                            <li>A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )</li>
                            <li>Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)</li>
                        </ul>
                    <p>
                        Remember that variable names are case-sensitive.
                    </p>
